# SteamGenBot 🔑

🔑 SteamGenBot is a telgram based steam key generator bot.
The steam keys in the text file are gotten from a public place. and I doesn't guarantee that they works.
This is just easy code without any third party SDKS dependency coded in pure PHP, and tested in PHP5.6

Demo: @SteamGenBot


## How to integrate the code with my your bot? 🤔

<ul>
<il> First download the files (steam.php and steam.txt) </il> </br >
<il> Edit steam.php and replace BOTOKEN:HERE123456789 with your bot token (on line 3)</il></br >
<il> Now upload it to your server (it must have valid https certificate) </il> </br >
<il> The URL should looklike https://www.example.com/path/to/the/file/steam.php </il> </br ></br >
<il> Set the webhook now :D https://api.telegram.org/botTOKEN:HERE/setWebhook?url=https://www.example.com/path/to/the/file/steam.php </br > 
</br ><il> And you will get Successfully set in json from telgram <il> </br >
<il> Now goto your bot and send /random </il></br >

Check the result :D
</ul>
